## Version 1.0 of my Python Password Generator

Allows you to:
-Generate a password using Letters, Digits or Special Characters <br>
-Choose which type of characters you want to see used <br>
-Set the desired password lenght <br>
-Will automatically copy the password to your clipboard <br>
-Will automatically export the password to a notepad called "Passwords.txt" <br>
-Gives you the possibility to (very intuitively and with no programming knowledge) use the notepad created by the Password Generator to record your password:website relations so that you won't ever have to guess where you used that password. <br>


  ## TROUBLESHOOTING:

    Microsoft Windows Defender flagged it as Malware: 
      - Most python codes are falsely detected by anti-virus softwares (including Microsoft Windows Defender)
        as malware due to most virus/malware creators using the same libraries to turn the .py into a .exe 
      - I have submitted my files to Microsoft and they verified it as being safe. 

            - If Microsoft Windows Defender removes the .exe from your computer you can either add it to the whitelist
              or update your computer's Windows Defender definitions by following these steps: 
            
               1.) Launch windows command prompt (CMD) as administrator and run the commands: 
                 1.1)  cd c:\Program Files\Windows Defender 
                 1.2)  MpCmdRun.exe -removedefinitions -dynamicsignatures
                 1.3)  MpCmdRun.exe -SignatureUpdate
              

            - Alternatively, the latest definition is available for download here:
